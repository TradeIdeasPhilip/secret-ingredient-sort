# Secret Ingredient Sort

This is the __easiest__ sort to learn.
There are many faster and more interesting sorting algorithms.
But let‚Äôs start with something simple and correct before trying to optimize things.

I created the bulk of this code as part of a [lesson](https://youtu.be/TTJ4RVAplDI?si=hJsQeVHz1EiqV2vH) I created on YouTube.
Watch [that video](https://youtu.be/TTJ4RVAplDI?si=hJsQeVHz1EiqV2vH) for more details.

I have cleaned up a little since recording the video.
I removed some irrelevant items from the template, and I added some simple instructions.
The algorithm remains unchanged.

## O(n) Sorting Algorithm

If the items are sorted before running this algorithm, then it only takes O(n) time.

That‚Äôs much faster than QuickSort and a lot of other popular sorting algorithms.
